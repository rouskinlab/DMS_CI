## About the DMS-MaPseq method

DMS-MaPseq is a chemical probing method combined with high throughput sequencing used to study RNA structure. The method is based on the chemical modification of RNA with a DMS reagent, which is then sequenced. The resulting data is a set of modified nucleotides, which can be used to infer the structure of the RNA. The DMS-MaPseq method is described in detail in the [DMS-MaPseq paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33326078/).



## About the confidence intervals method

The confidence intervals are calculated using the Wilson score interval with a sequencing error bias correction. Wilson score interval which has shown to perform better than bootstrapping for small sample sizes (<3,000 reads). The method is decribed in details below.

### Basics and terminology

The DMS-MaPseq method consists in amplificating one or several RNA molecules with a PCR, and then sequencing a sub-sample of the resulting RNA. The resulting data is a set of modified nucleotides, which can be used to infer the structure of the RNA. The mutation rate is typically around 1% to 10% for a given position.

- ``mutation`` = substitution of a nucleotide by another nucleotide
- ``read`` = a sequence of nucleotides that has been sequenced
- ``position`` = the position of a nucleotide in a sequence
- ``mutation rate`` = the probability of observing a mutation at a given position

We want to know, when observing a mutation rate at a certain position, what is a confidence interval for this value.

### Assumptions

We will assume that:
- The only sources of error are the random sampling of reads and the sequencing error.
- The sequencing error follows a binomial distribution $Bin(N,10^{-3})$ (see the [sequencing data error analysis paper](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1659-6)).
- The mutation rate is constant across the reads fot a certain position. This is not true in practice, but it is a good approximation for the purpose of this method (see **Why can we approximate the number of mutations with a binomial distribution** below).
- The experiment is perfectly reproducible.

### Model 

$$p_{errseq} = 10^{-3}$$

$$ p \sim Bin(N, \frac{n}{N}) -  Bin(N, p_{errseq}) $$

where p is the substitution rate in the sample, $n$ is the number of mutations and $N$ is the number of reads.

Given the small value of $p_{errseq}$, we can approximate the distribution as follows:

$$ p \sim Bin(N,max(0, \frac{n}{N} - p_{errseq}))$$



### Method 

We use the **Wilson score interval**, which is a method to calculate confidence intervals for binomial distributions.

$$ \hat{p} = max(0, \frac{n}{N} - p_{errseq}) $$

$$ z_{\alpha/2} = \Phi^{-1}(1-\alpha/2) $$

$$ \hat{p} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{N}} $$

where $n$ is the number of mutations, $N$ is the number of reads, and $z_{\alpha/2}$ is the $1-\alpha/2$ quantile of the standard normal distribution.

### Comparing experimentally different methods for binomial distributions confidence intervals

We compared the performances of the following methods:
- Bootstrapping
- Wilson score interval
- Clopper-Pearson interval
- Agresti-Coull interval
- Poisson interval by approximating the binomial distribution with a Poisson distribution
   
Wilson score has shown to be the best method for small sample sizes (<3,000 reads), and performs comparably to best-performing bootstrapping for larger sample sizes.

We use 4 real datasets to compare the methods. The mutation rate distribution across the positions is shown in the following figure.

The following figure shows the results of a simulation comparing the performance of different methods for binomial distributions confidence intervals. 
1. We loaded ``4 real datasets`` of over ``200,000 reads``, each read being ``170 nucleotides`` long. The mutation rate distribution across the positions is shown in figure A.
2. We subsampled ``N = [500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 5000, 10000] reads``,  ``10,000 times`` from each dataset, and calculated the confidence intervals for each position using the different methods.
3. For each read of ``170 nucleotides``, we calculated how many times the true mutation rate was within the confidence interval for each method. The distribution of this "success rate" is shown in figure B. 

A good method should have a small bias (e.g, be centered around 5%) and a small variance.

### Why can we approximate the number of mutations with a binomial distribution?

Let's say we have a set of ``N`` reads of a single nucleotide, and ``n`` of them are mutated. The mutation rate is then ``n/N``. We want a confidence interval for this mutation rate.

Let's define $p_i$ the probability of mutation for the i-th read. Then ``n`` follows the distribution 
$$f([p_1, p_2, ..., p_N]) := \sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i$$
where $X_i$ is a Bernoulli random variable with parameter $p_i$.

According to [the binomial sum variance inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_sum_variance_inequality), the variance of the sum of $N$ independent Bernoulli random variables is bounded by $Np(1-p)$, where $p$ is the mean of the Bernoulli random variables. In our case, 

$$ Var(f([p_1, p_2, ..., p_N])) â‰¤ Np(1-p) $$ 

$$p = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N p_i $$

Therefore, a confidence interval based on the binomial distribution $X \sim Bin(N, p)$ will encompass $f([p_1, p_2, ..., p_N])$.
